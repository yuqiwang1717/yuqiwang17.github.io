**Yuqi Wang**  
_PhD Student in Curriculum and Pedagogy, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto_


Hi, I’m Yuqi Wang, a second-year (soon third) PhD student in the Department of Curriculum, Teaching, and Learning at the University of Toronto. I have an interdisciplinary background in engineering, design, and education. My research lies at the intersection of immersive technologies, curriculum theory, and human-computer interaction.

My current work explores how embodied experiences and interactive systems can serve as dynamic forms of curriculum. I’m particularly interested in how learners construct meaning through doing, sensing, and interacting with interactive systems—positioning learning as a continuous, lived process.

Our recent paper, *From Temporal to Spatial: Designing Spatialized Interactions with Segmented-audios in Immersive Environments for Active Engagement with Performing Arts Intangible Cultural Heritage*, was accepted to ACM DIS 2025 and received an Honorable Mention award.
